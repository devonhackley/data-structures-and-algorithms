# Tree
This read me contains information various tree implementations.

## Challenge
Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree as inputs. Traverse thru tree and print out each node's value.

## Approach & Efficiency
FizzBuzzTree(Tree tree)
    * Time: O(n)
    * Space: O(n)


## API
  ### Methods:
 * breadthFirstTraversal(Tree tree): 
     * passes tree root to helper function.
 * breadthTraversal(Node node):
     * Traverses thru tree nodes and prints out each node's value

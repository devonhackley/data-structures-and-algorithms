# Tree
This read me contains information various tree implementations.

## Challenge
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value.

## Approach & Efficiency
FizzBuzzTree(Tree tree)
    * Time: O(n)
    * Space: O(1)


## API
  ### Methods:
  FizzBuzzTree:
 * FizzBuzzTree(Tree tree): 
     * Takes in a tree and determines if each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both 3 and 5. 
 * traveseThruNodes(Node node):
     * Takes in a node and recursively traverse thru the structure
 * checkNode(Node node):
     * Takes in a node and checks if that number if divisible by 3, 5 or both.
